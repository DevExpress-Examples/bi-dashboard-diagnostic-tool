# BI Dashboard Diagnostic Tool

The BI Dashboard Diagnostic Tool is a performance monitoring system that allows you to inspect specific activities during code execution of the main DevExpress BI Dashboard's data processing areas. For example, you can estimate execution time for different operations or see the number of code calls for the session period. 

## Example Overview

The BI Dashboard Diagnostic Tool consists of three projects:

- [DashboardDiagnosticToolUI](./DashboardDiagnosticToolUI) 

  The main project that contains a user interface to display and analyze your session data.

  Read more: [The Dashboard Diagnostic Tool UI](./DashboardDiagnosticToolUI/readme.md)

- [DiagnosticTool](./DiagnosticTool) 

  Contains the source code of the BI Dashboard Diagnostic Tool.
  
- [DiagnosticToolTest](./DiagnosticToolTest)

  For internal use. Contains the BI Dashboard Diagnostic Tool tests.

## Prerequisites

Specify your DevExpress NuGet feed autorization key in [nuget.config](./nuget.config#L7).

## Use Diagnostic Tool in the UI

1. Run the Diagnostic Tool.

2. Select **Start Session**.

3. Run the code you want to diagnose.

4. Click **Stop Session** after the code complied. Wait for the log tree to be built.

5. Save the report.

You can analyze the resulting report or send it to [Support Centre](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/list) for help.

## Use Diagnostic Tool in Code

1. Reference `DiagnosticTool.dll` and install the [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent/) package in your dashboard project. 

3. Create a `DiagnosticController` object. 

4. Call the conroller's Start() and Stop() methods to collect performance data for your code. 

5. Implement the `IFileController` interface and specify the output file path in the `TrySaveFile` method. Pass a new class instance that implements `IFileController` to the controller's contructor. 

6. Call the controller's `SaveAs` method to generate an XML report.
